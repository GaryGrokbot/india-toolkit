# Cultural Sensitivity Guide

## Purpose

Animal advocacy in India operates in a minefield of caste, religion, and communal politics. This guide defines what this toolkit does and does not do.

## Core Principles

1. **Animal welfare for all animals, not cow politics for one party.** We do not participate in cow vigilantism, Hindutva-aligned cow protection, or any movement that selectively values one species for religious-political reasons while ignoring others.

2. **No caste-based food shaming.** We never frame vegetarianism as "pure" or meat-eating as "impure." These are casteist categories that have been used to dehumanize Dalit, Adivasi, and Muslim communities for centuries.

3. **Food sovereignty is a right.** Every person has the right to decide what they eat. Our work targets industrial systems, not individual food choices.

4. **Workers are not the enemy.** Slaughterhouse workers, poultry farm laborers, and leather workers are overwhelmingly from marginalized communities. They are exploited by the same system that exploits animals. Our advocacy must include their welfare.

5. **Language matters.** Use accessible Hindustani, not Sanskritized Hindi. Sanskritized vocabulary excludes Urdu speakers, Muslims, and many non-Hindi-belt populations.

## Avoid

### Caste Framing
- "Shuddh shakahari" (pure vegetarian) — purity language is casteist
- "Satvik/tamsik/rajsik" food classification — maps to caste hierarchy
- Any framing that implies vegetarians are morally superior to meat-eaters
- Ignoring that forced vegetarianism has been a tool of caste oppression

### Cow Politics
- "Gau mata" (mother cow) rhetoric — entangled with Hindutva
- "Gau raksha" (cow protection) — associated with lynchings of Dalits and Muslims
- Beef ban advocacy — beef bans have been weaponized against marginalized communities
- Selective concern for cows while ignoring chickens, pigs, fish, goats
- Any alignment with VHP, Bajrang Dal, or similar organizations

### Religious Framing
- Framing animal welfare as a "Hindu" value
- Using religious texts as primary authority (cite law and science instead)
- "Bharat is a vegetarian nation" — factually false (71% of Indians are non-vegetarian per NFHS-5)
- Assuming that all Hindus are vegetarian or should be

### Sanskritized Hindi
- "Jal" instead of "paani" (water)
- "Pashu" instead of "janwar" (animal) — except in formal/legal contexts
- "Aushadhi" instead of "dawai" (medicine)
- "Swasthya" instead of "sehat" (health) — in casual register
- Any vocabulary that signals upper-caste/Sanskrit education as prerequisite

## Embrace

### Cross-Community Framing
- Ahimsa as shared across Jain, Buddhist, Gandhian, and broader Indian traditions
- Environmental justice (water, pollution) — affects all communities
- Health and food safety — universal concern
- Economic justice — corporate exploitation vs. small farmer dignity
- Worker rights and occupational safety

### Dalit-Bahujan Solidarity
- Center the voices and agency of affected communities
- Recognize that factory farming harms workers from marginalized castes
- Support food sovereignty: the right to choose what you eat
- Acknowledge that the animal advocacy movement has historically been upper-caste dominated
- Partner with, not speak for, Dalit-Bahujan organizations

### Evidence-Based Advocacy
- Cite laws (PCA Act, FSS Act, Water Act), not religious texts
- Use government data (FSSAI surveys, livestock census, CGWB data)
- Reference Supreme Court judgments (Nagaraja, Laxmi Narain Modi)
- Provide specific, verifiable claims with sources
- Acknowledge uncertainty where data is incomplete

## Content Review Checklist

Before publishing any content, check:

- [ ] Does it avoid purity/pollution language?
- [ ] Does it avoid cow-specific religious framing?
- [ ] Does it include worker welfare perspective (if about slaughter/meat)?
- [ ] Is the Hindi accessible (Hindustani register, not Sanskritized)?
- [ ] Does it target systems, not individuals' food choices?
- [ ] Has it been reviewed by someone from a non-upper-caste perspective?
- [ ] Are all claims sourced and verifiable?
- [ ] Does it provide alternatives, not just criticism?

## The Speciesism-Casteism Intersection

Factory farming in India reproduces caste hierarchies:
- Upper-caste Hindus consume dairy while delegating slaughter to Dalits and Muslims
- The same people who worship cows abandon male calves to die
- Poultry farm workers (often Dalit) face occupational hazards with no protection
- "Clean" processed dairy brands (Amul, Nandini) obscure the "dirty" work done by marginalized communities

Our analysis must name this intersection. An animal advocacy that ignores caste is not liberation — it is upper-caste environmentalism.
